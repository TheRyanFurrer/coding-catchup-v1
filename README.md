# coding-catchup-v1
An old version of my personal blog, Coding Catchup

I designed and built this blog with plain ol' HTML and CSS. I obviously did not write more than one blog on this site, however, you can read about my process of building it on [The Ryan Furrer Blog](https://www.theryanfurrer.blog/blog/starting-anew/).


This blog has since been rebranded and moved to [The Ryan Furrer Blog](https://www.theryanfurrer.blog/).
