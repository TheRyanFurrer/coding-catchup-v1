        <h2>Let's try this again</h2>
        <p>Wow, I’m back…again.</p>
        <p>It’s been a while since I’ve written a blog post, yet it’s been on my mind for some time. To be honest, I
          feel like my journey has been on pause for a while…for no fault other than my own discipline running dry and I
          stopped looking to code as much as I was.</p>

        <p>
          But you know what never left? The guilt that I /wasn’t/ coding. I think it’s because I knew that I should be
          developing my skills and working towards that web developer job but I just kind of stopped.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless, I wanted/needed to get back into it. The fact that my itch to become a Web Developer hasn’t left
          is a huge sign to me that it’s truly my passion. In my absence I still read about it, still watched videos
          about it, and still did some coding here and there - I even created my future wedding website!</p>

        <h2>Onto the building from scratch...</h2>

        <p>
          You may have seen my <a href="https://dev.to/ryan_furrer/simple-ways-to-build-your-own-blog-4j9m"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last post</a>, Simple Ways To Build Your Own Blog, in which I
          built a blog using <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stackbit</a>.
          That was quick and easy and works really well! However, then I stopped writing, again. So as time went on and
          my itch for writing came back I couldn’t get the idea out of my head to create my own blog site from
          scratch…so here we are!
        </p>

        <p>
          With the idea of starting anew I wanted to create something clean, simple, modern, and performant - this is
          also how I want to treat my dive back into my journey. I wanted to simplify my design ideas and color palette
          as well. I see a lot of minimal websites and love the look and feel, so that’s where I started.
        </p>

        <p>So what did I use to build the site? Good old HTML and CSS - There’s nothing much more minimal than those!
          I’ll likely implement some light JS in the future but there’s no need to bog the site down unnecessarily.</p>

        <p>Technologies out of the way, I wanted to pick a color palette and I used <a href="https://coolors.co/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coolors</a> to help me out. The “Tea Green” (#C2EABD) and “Oxford
          Blue” (#011936) were paired together and I loved them right away…to be honest they give me some <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color#Color_palettes" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Boy Color Palettes </a> vibes. From there I made a couple of edits and used
          just 5 colors across both dark and light themes.</p>

          <img class="blog-image" src="../../images/posts/001 - Starting Anew/images/cc-light-theme.png"
            alt="Coding Catchup's Light Theme Colors">
          <figcaption>Coding Catchup's light theme palette</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Color palettes and technologies decided, it was time to get going on this build!</p>

        <h2>Building, Styling, and Finalizing</h2>

        <p>
          Building the blog didn’t take long at all - it’s dead simple, after all. I started with the homepage, followed
          by the about page, then the blogs page. That’s it, just 3 pages!
        </p>

        <p>Keeping the simple and clean approach in mind, it really made creating the layout quite easy. There’s nothing
          new or special to my site, but it’s built and designed how I like it, hopefully you’ll all like it as well!
        </p>

        <p>Throughout the building process I had little styling ideas here and there to make the site a little less
          plain, but again, it’s a pretty simple design and site. No frills and a bigger focus on the content.</p>

        <p>I tested the site on multiple different browsers including Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox on both my 2012
          MacBook Air and my desktop PC using 27” 4k monitors. I also tested it on several mobile devices including
          iPhone 6s, iPhone XS, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and a Samsung A50. Keeping it simple made responsiveness simple, a
          nice perk!</p>

        <p>I also used a slightly modified version of Andy Bell’s <a
            href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS
            Reset</a>. I’ve mentioned this before but it’s just a solid little file that makes building pages so much
          nicer.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>

        <p>Moving forward I have just a few ideas to bring more to Coding Catchup. Those things include:</p>

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>An actual logo</li>
          <li>Theme toggle</li>
          <li>Email subscription form</li>
          <li>Implementing a CMS</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>And that’s it! Thanks for reading my foray back into blogging (again) and re-igniting the journey to my first
          Web Developer job. Feel free to check out <a href="https://codingcatchup.com/" target="_blank"
